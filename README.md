# Control_MBD_buck Repository Analysis

## Project Overview

The repository focuses on control theory and model based design techniques applied to buck converter systems. This project demonstrates advanced control strategies for DC-DC power conversion, specifically targeting buck converter topologies using systematic model-based design methodologies.

## Repository Structure and Content

The repository is organized into four main folders, each representing different control approaches and supporting materials:

### 1. golden_model
Contains the simulink golden reference model - this serves as the baseline buck converter implementation that other control variants are compared against. The golden model likely includes the fundamental buck converter topology with basic control mechanisms.

### 2. references
Contains the references used as a starting point for the model - this folder includes academic papers, technical specifications, industry standards, or existing implementations that informed the buck converter design and control strategies.

### 3. pid
Contains a PID controlled variant of the golden reference model - this implements Proportional-Integral-Derivative control for the buck converter, which is a classical and widely-used control approach in power electronics for voltage regulation.

### 4. fuzzy
Contains a fuzzy logic controlled variant of the golden reference model - this represents an advanced, intelligent control approach using fuzzy logic principles for buck converter regulation, offering potential advantages in handling non-linearities and uncertainties.
 
## Documentation

The repository includes a **README.pdf** file which is a short report describing the process followed in order to get the models and code artifacts in the repo. This document likely provides:

- Design methodology and approach
- Simulation results and performance comparisons
- Implementation details and considerations
- Conclusions and recommendations


## Conclusion

This repository represents a comprehensive study of control strategies for buck converter applications. It demonstrates model-based design practices, provides comparative analysis between classical and intelligent control approaches, and serves as an educational and professional reference for power electronics control system design.
