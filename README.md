# Control_MBD_buck

This repo is about control theory and model based design techniques.
The content of each folder is summarised below:
* golden_model: holds the simulink golden reference model,
* references: is the folder with the references used as a starting point for the model,
* pid: this folder holds a PID controlled variant of the golden reference model,
* fuzzy: here there is a fuzzy logic controlled variant of the golden reference model instead.
  
The "README.pdf" file is a short report describing the process followed in order to get the models and code artifacts in the repo.
